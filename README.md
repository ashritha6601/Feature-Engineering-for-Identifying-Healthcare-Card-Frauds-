# Feature-Engineering-for-Identifying-Healthcare-Card-Frauds
•	Engineered 15 features for detecting healthcare card frauds deployed feature engineering techniques, imputation, categorical encoding, binning, PCA and built prediction model to detect outliers using HBOS.
•	Evaluated model using precision, recall, AUC-ROC achieving lowest RMSE of 0.6 and optimized model's performance with cross-validation and PyOD to avoid overfitting.
